 I'm continuing work on PaidSearchNav's BigQuery integration for customer cost tracking. We've implemented a comprehensive BigQuery integration with:

  1. Complete BigQuery service modules (auth, service, analytics, streaming, cost_monitor, cost_tracker)
  2. Customer cost tracking system for accurate billing
  3. API endpoints for BigQuery functionality
  4. Hybrid architecture: CSV (Standard) + BigQuery (Premium/Enterprise) tiers
  5. 5 GitHub issues created for phased implementation
  6. Complete documentation (connection guide, cost tracking strategies)

  Current status: All core implementation is complete.

  Next steps needed:
  1. Test the BigQuery integration endpoints using the running API server
  2. Verify customer cost tracking functionality works correctly
  3. Test the connection methods (Application Default Credentials, Service Account)
  4. Run integration tests to ensure everything works end-to-end
  5. Address any issues found during testing

  The API server is currently running via Docker. Please help me test and validate the BigQuery integration implementation.

  This prompt will:
  - Provide context about completed work
  - Indicate the current state (implementation done, testing needed)
  - Reference the running API server for immediate testing
  - Give clear next steps for validation
  - Allow the new session to pick up exactly where we left off

  The new Claude session will be able to immediately start testing the implementation using the running Docker container and validate that all the BigQuery cost tracking features work as designed.
