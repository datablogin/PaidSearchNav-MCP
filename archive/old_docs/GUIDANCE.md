# Quarterly Google Ads Keyword Audit Guide (Retail Local Focus)

**Introduction:**
Performing a comprehensive **keyword audit every quarter** helps retail businesses with physical storefronts optimize their Google Ads campaigns for cost efficiency and local impact. This guide provides a step-by-step process to review your search keywords, match types, search queries, and location performance, with additional tips for **Performance Max** campaigns. The goal is to identify wasted spend, improve targeting (especially for local intent), and ensure no internal conflicts hinder campaign delivery. Use this repeatable process each quarter (or as an on-demand audit service) to keep campaigns running efficiently.

## Step 1: Review Keyword Match Types and Structure

A well-run account typically uses a **mix of match types** (Exact, Phrase, Broad), each serving a purpose. Start by exporting your keyword list and segmenting by match type. Check for common pitfalls:

* **Overuse of Broad Match:** If all or most keywords are Broad (Google’s default), you might be getting lots of loosely related traffic. Broad match can help discover new queries, but it often triggers irrelevant searches that hurt click-through and conversion rates. Identify Broad keywords with poor ROI and consider tightening them (e.g. switch to Phrase/Exact or add qualifiers/negatives).
* **Over-restrictive Match Types:** Conversely, using only Phrase or Exact for all keywords can limit volume and miss potential customers. Ensure high-intent terms are covered with Exact match, but allow some Phrase or Broad variants to capture “long-tail” searches. Balance **volume vs. relevance** by mixing match types – for example, use Broad match (with smart bidding or careful negatives) for discovery and Exact for your core terms.
* **Keyword Grouping:** Audit your ad group structure. Each ad group should focus on a tight theme of keywords (preferably 15–20 keywords max) so that ads can be highly relevant. If you find an ad group with a very large, varied list, plan to break it into smaller groups by theme. This improves Quality Score and ad relevance.
* **Quality Score Check:** Identify keywords with low Quality Scores, as they may be too broad or not aligned with ad/landing page content. Low scores increase costs. Aim for Quality Score 7+ by using relevant keywords in your ads and pages.

**Tip:** Document the distribution of match types (e.g. 50% Broad, 30% Phrase, 20% Exact) and performance metrics for each. If Broad matches have significantly worse CPA or CTR, that’s a signal to refine. On the other hand, if smart bidding + Broad is delivering good conversions, ensure negatives are in place to maintain efficiency (see Step 2).

## Step 2: Analyze Search Terms Report for Query Insights

The **Search Terms Report** is your best friend in a keyword audit. It shows the actual queries that triggered your ads. For the last 3 months, pull the search terms for each campaign (or account-wide) and systematically review them:

* **Identify Irrelevant Queries:** Look for search terms that are unrelated to your business or indicate low intent. These are budget-wasters. Add them to your **negative keyword list** so your ads won’t show for those searches. For example, a gym might add negatives for “free gym wallpapers” if such queries appeared and don’t relate to signups. *Negatives are critical for cost efficiency*, yet they’re often forgotten. Proactively removing irrelevant terms will save budget and improve ROI.
* **Find High-Value Queries:** Identify search terms that converted well or have high CTR but aren’t already in your keyword list. These **“Not added and has conversions”** queries (to borrow a scripting term) are candidates to add as new keywords. Adding them (preferably as Exact or Phrase) lets you bid more precisely on these terms and tailor ad copy to them. This can lift your Quality Score and conversion volume.
* **Match Type Effectiveness:** For each significant search query, note which keyword (and match type) triggered it. Are your Phrase/Exact keywords effectively capturing the intended queries? If you see important queries coming only through Broad match, consider adding them as Phrase/Exact to gain control. Also check if any Broad keywords are matching to very broad or unrelated terms – if so, tighten those keywords or add the mismatched term as a negative.
* **Performance Metrics:** Sort search terms by cost to find those that spent a lot with few or no conversions. These likely need to be excluded (add as negatives) or addressed (maybe the keyword or ad isn’t aligned). Also look at conversion rate by query – queries with good conversion rate might deserve higher bids or dedicated budgets. Queries with high bounce rates or low time-on-site (if you have Google Analytics data) could indicate misalignment.

Performing this search term review quarterly ensures you **evolve your keyword list** continuously. You’ll catch new trends (seasonal search queries or new slang), and eliminate emerging sources of waste. As one PPC expert notes, regularly mining search terms uncovers new negatives and positives – it’s how campaigns *evolve* and stay efficient.

**Automation Tip:** Instead of manually filtering every time, consider using a Google Ads Script to automate search query analysis. For example, a script can scan all queries in the last 90 days and label them as: already added, not added (new), high-converting, or low-performing. It can output results to a Google Sheet and even highlight “not added + has conversions” and “not excluded + low performing” queries. This saves time and ensures no valuable query or bad egg slips through the cracks. You can schedule such a script to run before each quarterly audit and come prepared with a list of recommended keyword additions and negatives.

## Step 3: Identify and Resolve Keyword Conflicts (Negatives vs. Positives)

&#x20;*Example: A keyword conflict report highlighting search terms blocked by negative keywords.*
Even a well-curated negative list can backfire if it **conflicts** with your active keywords. A conflict occurs when a negative keyword (at the account, campaign, or ad group level) is blocking your ad from showing on a search term that **should** trigger one of your positive keywords. This can cause campaigns to underdeliver or miss potential conversions silently. To audit conflicts:

* **Scan for Conflicting Negatives:** Manually review your negative keyword lists and cross-check against your active keywords. Look for overlaps where a negative is the same or broader than a term you target. For example, if you have a broad negative `-free` but offer a “free trial” keyword, the negative will block the “free trial” keyword from showing. Common accidental conflicts include negatives like “cheap” or “discount” that might block your long-tail keywords containing those words. Use Google Ads’ Recommendations tab as a starting point – it will sometimes flag “remove conflicting negative keywords” when it detects them. However, **don’t rely solely on auto-recommendations**; review each suggestion before removal to ensure the negative isn’t intentionally in place for other campaigns.
* **Use Scripts or Tools:** Since Google Ads doesn’t provide a built-in conflict report (unlike Microsoft Ads which has one), leverage third-party tools or scripts. PromoNavi’s **Conflicting Negative Keywords** tool, for example, can scan your account and list out negatives that block active keywords. Google also provides sample **Ads Scripts** for this: one script for single accounts and another for manager accounts will find any keyword-negative conflicts, output them to a spreadsheet, and even email you an alert. You can run these scripts on schedule (e.g. monthly) so that conflicts are caught promptly. This proactive approach is valuable for large accounts where manual checks are impractical.
* **Resolve and Document:** When you find a conflict, decide how to fix it: Often the solution is to remove or modify the negative keyword. In some cases, you might narrow the match type of the negative (e.g. change a broad negative to phrase or exact) so it stops blocking the legitimate term. In other cases, you might keep the negative (if it’s broadly useful) and instead adjust your positive keyword strategy (e.g. bid on a different variation that doesn’t trigger the negative). **Document which negatives you removed or altered**, so you can explain changes to stakeholders or revert if needed.
* **Check Duplicate Keywords:** While not exactly a negative conflict, also audit for duplicate or overly similar keywords across your account. If the same keyword exists in multiple ad groups or campaigns (especially with different match types), they could compete or cause Google to only serve one of them. Unify or remove duplicates to let each query map to a single best-fitting keyword. This simplifies management and can improve Quality Score by concentrating performance data.

Regularly auditing negatives ensures you’re *not inadvertently hampering your reach*. Conflicting negatives can lower impressions and clicks, and ultimately conversions, without you realizing why. A quick QA of “negatives vs positives” each quarter prevents this. As WordStream advises, **use a fine-toothed comb on your negative lists** to ensure none are “blocking impressions for any of your keywords”. The result is a cleaner, conflict-free keyword set that maximizes eligible impressions.

## Step 4: Evaluate Performance by Location & “Store-Level” Intent

For businesses driving in-store visits, it’s crucial to audit how your keywords and ads perform **geographically**. Different store locations or regions may exhibit different cost per conversion and search behavior. In this step, you’ll analyze location data to ensure your campaigns are optimized for local impact:

* **Review Geo-Performance Reports:** Google Ads offers geographic reports under the *Locations* tab for each campaign. Start by checking that your campaigns are targeting the correct areas (no states or cities outside your service area). Then use the *User Location* or *Geographic* report to see performance by country, state, city, or zip code. You can “narrow” the location view to drill down from broader regions into more granular areas. Identify any regions or cities with **exceptional performance** (high conversion rates, low CPA) or **poor performance** (high spend with low returns). For high-performing locales, consider allocating more budget or bidding higher there to maximize those results. For low-performing areas, you might lower bids, refine ad messaging, or even exclude the location if it’s not yielding results. *Example:* If your bakery’s ads perform great in City A but poorly in City B, you could reallocate spend proportionally or craft location-specific ads (see next point).
* **Align Keywords/Ads with Local Intent:** “Store-level intent” refers to searches indicating the user’s local context or immediate intent to visit. Audit whether your keyword set covers common local intent phrases. This includes keywords with “near me”, city/neighborhood names, or terms like “open now”. Check your search terms report for these signals; if people are searching “gym near me” or “bakery in downtown <city>” and you don’t have those as keywords, consider adding them (perhaps as Phrase match “bakery downtown”). Also ensure your ad copy or extensions highlight the nearest store or city to capitalize on that local intent. **Location extensions (Location assets)** should be enabled and associated with each store – this allows your address to show and unlocks the Google Maps placement. Ads with location extensions can get a boost for “near me” queries by showing distance to your store.
* **Use the Distance Report (if applicable):** If you use radius targeting or have location extensions, Google’s *Distance Report* is extremely insightful. It breaks down performance by the distance of the user from your business location (e.g. 0-5 miles, 5-10 miles, etc.). Analyze this to see how far people travel or search from. You might find, for example, that 80% of conversions come from within 5 miles of your stores. If so, you might tighten your geo targeting or bid higher for closer radii. On the other hand, if significant conversions occur at 10-15 miles, ensure your targeting covers that range or consider expanding radius. The distance report can reveal if **cost per conversion rises with distance** – often it does, as users farther away are less likely to convert. You can then decide if the higher CPA at far distances is acceptable or if you should concentrate budget nearer to the store.
* **Per-Store Performance:** For multi-location businesses, try to get store-specific performance data. Google Ads’ location extension report can show metrics by each physical store location (if set up via Business Profile). Evaluate if certain stores are lagging. If one location has high spend but few store visit conversions, something may be off (maybe a local landing page issue or local competition). You might split that store into its own campaign with tailored keywords/budget. Also compare how keywords perform in different regions – e.g., “oil change coupons” might do well near your suburban auto shop but not as well downtown. Use geo bid adjustments or campaign segmentation to account for these differences.

By evaluating location data, you ensure your **primary goal (cost efficiency)** is met in each area and you’re not bleeding budget in low-yield regions. It also supports your secondary goal of campaign functionality – properly set location targeting and negatives prevent your ads from showing where your stores can’t serve customers (for example, exclude countries or far-away cities that accidentally slipped into targeting). A quarterly geo-analysis lets you adapt to any changes in local demand or competition (seasonal shifts, new competitors in town, etc.). Remember to revisit location settings at least every few months – cities grow, demographics shift, and your campaigns should too.

## Step 5: Incorporate Performance Max Campaign Insights

Performance Max (PMax) campaigns don’t use traditional keywords, but they **can still impact your search results and strategy**. If you’re running PMax alongside search campaigns, follow these audit considerations:

* **Check PMax Search Queries:** Recently, Google has introduced **search terms reporting for Performance Max**. In your Google Ads account, review the PMax search terms to see what actual queries PMax ads appeared for. This is crucial because it gives you transparency into PMax’s “black box” of search intent. Identify any queries that **don’t align with your business or goals** – you can now add negative keywords at the campaign or account level to block those in PMax. For example, if your PMax campaign for “local bakery” is oddly showing for “bakery franchise opportunities” (unwanted query), add “franchise” as a negative keyword to the PMax campaign or account. The new search terms visibility also lets you spot high-performing queries from PMax that you might not have in your regular search campaigns. Consider **adding those queries as exact-match keywords in your Search campaigns** to have more control over messaging and bidding for them. PMax’s broad reach can uncover new local search trends which you can then capitalize on manually.
* **Avoid Cannibalization Between Search and PMax:** Google’s official stance is that exact match search keywords take priority over PMax for the same query. However, for queries that match your phrase or broad keywords (or aren’t in your search campaigns at all), PMax might also serve ads. In practice, studies have found some overlap – in one analysis, about 2.8% of PMax search terms overlapped with existing Search campaign keywords, and 67% of PMax campaigns had at least one overlapping term with Search. During your audit, check if PMax is **cannibalizing** important searches that your Search campaigns are also targeting. Signs of this could be your Search campaign seeing lower impressions or conversions for a core keyword while PMax’s conversions are high. One remedy is to add key branded or high-value terms as **negatives in PMax** (at account level) so that the Search campaign always gets those impressions. Many advertisers exclude their brand terms from PMax for this reason – to prevent PMax from scooping up easy branded conversions. Also ensure any **high-intent local queries** (like “gym near me <city>”) that you want handled by Search are indeed covered as exact keywords; otherwise, PMax might serve for them and you lose the ability to show a tailored ad. The overarching strategy: let PMax fill in the gaps, but **make sure your Search campaigns cover the critical queries explicitly**. As one expert noted, for lead gen you’ll “want your top search terms to show Search ads” for better CTRs and conversion rates – thus structure your negatives and keyword coverage accordingly.
* **Location and Asset Alignment:** PMax campaigns automatically use all Google channels, including Maps. If driving store visits is a goal, confirm that your PMax is set up with location assets (so it can show store info) and that it’s targeting the correct geographic areas. Unlike Search, PMax doesn’t have per-campaign location settings in the same way (it can use your account-level or campaign-level geo-targeting broadly). Ensure no discrepancy, such as PMax accidentally targeting outside your local area, which could waste spend. Additionally, PMax’s asset groups might benefit from localization – for example, use images or text in asset groups that speak to local audiences if possible (“Visit our Austin bakery – fresh daily!”). While PMax will optimize creative automatically, feeding it some **local flavor** in assets could improve relevance for nearby users.
* **Measure PMax’s Local Impact:** If you have access to Google’s “store visit” conversion tracking or offline conversion imports, compare how PMax vs Search contribute. It might be that PMax finds more upper-funnel users and Search closes the deal, or vice versa. The new **channel breakdown** in PMax reporting (rolling out in 2025) will even show how much performance comes from Search vs Maps vs YouTube, etc. Use these insights to adjust budgets – e.g., if PMax is great at driving Map clicks for directions, that’s valuable for in-store visits, but if it’s mostly showing Display ads with little local action, you might dial back its budget in favor of search. The key is to integrate PMax into your audit rather than treat it as a separate silo. Now that **full search term data** is available for PMax, you can largely apply the same rigor to it as you do for Search campaigns: evaluate queries, negatives, and performance metrics, and make data-driven adjustments.

In summary, **don’t ignore PMax in a keyword audit** just because it has no keywords. Its automated reach can both uncover new opportunities and pose new challenges. By auditing PMax’s search query performance and controlling overlap, you ensure the PMax automation works in harmony with your regular search campaigns, rather than against them. As of 2025, Google has made strides in transparency (search term reports, channel reporting) – use these new tools to maintain control and efficiency in your account.

## Step 6: Automate and Streamline Audit Tasks

A quarterly audit can be labor-intensive, but many checks can be **automated or sped up** with tools. Investing time in automation now pays off in future cycles and makes an audit service offering more scalable:

* **Google Ads Scripts:** As mentioned, scripts are powerful for recurring analyses. Besides the search query and conflict scripts already discussed, consider scripts for other aspects:

  * *High-Cost/Low-Conversions Alert:* A script can scan for keywords that spent over X in the quarter with zero or below-threshold conversions and email you a list. This flags which keywords to pause or adjust immediately.
  * *Match Type Performance Report:* Write a script to aggregate performance by match type (Broad/Phrase/Exact) each quarter. If you see, for example, Broad match CPA is 2x Exact match CPA with similar conversion volume, that insight could guide budget reallocation.
  * *N-Gram or Query Theme Analysis:* For large accounts, an N-gram script can group search queries by common words to spot themes (e.g., a lot of queries containing “cheap” or “24 hour”). This might reveal a need for new negatives or new ad messaging.
  * *Negative List Consistency:* If you use shared negative lists (e.g. a master irrelevant terms list), a script can ensure all campaigns have the appropriate lists applied (preventing scenarios where one campaign is missing a crucial negative).

  Google Ads Scripts can be scheduled (daily, weekly, etc.) so that by the time you do your quarterly audit, you have fresh data and even some fixes already implemented (if you use automated rules). Google provides a library of sample scripts and many community scripts are freely available for such tasks. Use them to reduce manual grunt work and focus your time on strategic decisions.

* **Looker Studio (Google Data Studio):** For a high-level **dashboard view** of your account that’s updated in real-time, Looker Studio is invaluable. You can create visualizations that directly support your audit:

  * A dashboard page for **Geographic Performance** – e.g. a map or table showing CPA and conversion by city/region. This can quickly highlight outliers each quarter without digging through the Ads UI.
  * A **Keyword Quality Score vs. Performance** chart – see if low QS keywords are dragging down results and need fixing or removing.
  * A **Match Type Trend** – e.g. a pie chart or time series of spend by match type, to monitor if maybe broad match spend is creeping up over time.
  * A **Top Search Queries** table – using the Google Ads connector, you can pull in search terms with filters (like top cost or containing certain words) to have a ready list of potential negatives/positives.

  Looker Studio allows blending data sources too. You could blend Google Ads data with Google Analytics metrics (bounce rate, time on site by query or location) for deeper insight. Another idea is a **store-level scorecard**: if each store has its own campaign or identifiable tag, create a scorecard per store showing key KPIs (cost, conversions, ROAS, etc.). This would support an on-demand audit service where you can easily generate a report for each store location’s campaign performance.

* **Third-Party PPC Tools:** There are several reputable tools that can automate parts of your audit and provide “audit reports” with recommendations:

  * **Optmyzr** – Offers a suite of PPC audit rules and one-click optimizations. For instance, it can highlight conflicting negatives, suggest new negatives from queries, and check for duplicate keywords automatically.
  * **Adalysis** – Known for its audit and monitoring features, Adalysis can continuously check your account against best practices. It has a built-in negative conflict checker, alerts for underperforming keywords, and even specialized PMax analysis modules. This tool can essentially run a mini-audit every day and notify you of issues (great for ensuring ongoing campaign *functionality*).
  * **PromoNavi** – As mentioned, it has a conflict finder and other auditing tools. It also provides budgeting and reporting tools that could complement your audit workflow.
  * **Google Ads Performance Grader (WordStream)** – This free tool quickly evaluates your account structure and performance relative to benchmarks. While not a deep audit, it’s a fast way to spot glaring issues. Running it quarterly can validate that your manual audit didn’t miss anything obvious (for example, it might flag “too many broad keywords” or “no negative list applied to X campaign”).
  * **Looker Studio Templates & Connectors:** If building a dashboard from scratch is daunting, resources like the **Google Ads Report Templates** (Google has official ones, and communities have shared templates) can jump-start your reporting. Also consider using **BigQuery** if you have large data – exporting Google Ads data to BigQuery and using SQL can allow very advanced audit analyses (like querying billions of rows of search queries efficiently). This is more for power users or agencies turning audits into products.

**Pro Tip:** Automate **report generation** for clients or stakeholders. If you’re offering this audit as a premium service, create a standardized report (maybe in Looker or a slide deck template) where charts and tables can be easily updated with the latest data. This could include an executive summary of findings, key metrics by location, and a checklist of recommended actions (pause X keywords, add Y negatives, etc.). Automation here means after doing the analysis, you can plug the results into a pre-formatted report quickly, ensuring consistency and professionalism in deliverables.

## Step 7: Summarize Findings and Implement Changes

After completing the audit steps above, compile a summary of **findings and action items**:

* List **keywords to pause or bid down** (e.g. poor performers, duplicates, conflict-creating terms). Note why – e.g., “Paused \[DIY gym equipment] Broad match due to high spend and low conversion (CPA \$120, 3× avg) – focus budget on ‘gym membership’ keywords instead.”
* List **negative keywords to add** (with match type and level). E.g., “Add negative Phrase ‘cheap’ at campaign level to filter out bargain searches that didn’t convert.” Ensure no conflict with positives.
* List **new keywords to add** (and recommended match type) based on search term opportunities. For each, mention the intent and which ad group it fits or if a new ad group is needed.
* Document any **match type adjustments** (e.g. “Changed +5 keywords from Broad to Phrase where query mapping was too broad”).
* Note **location targeting changes**: which locations get bid adjustments, added, or excluded. Also note if you decided to split campaigns by geography or apply radius targeting tweaks.
* Outline **Performance Max adjustments**: any negatives added to PMax, budget shifts between PMax and Search, new asset groups for locations, etc. If PMax is now giving you useful search term data, you might list a couple of high-value PMax queries you plan to move into Search campaigns as exact keywords.
* Identify any **landing page or ad copy needs** discovered. (While auditing keywords, you might realize some ad copy doesn’t reflect a query’s intent, or a local landing page is missing for a city keyword. Note these as follow-ups.)
* **Conversion tracking review**: Though beyond keywords, ensure any new store visit or offline conversion tracking is working, since local campaigns rely on those metrics for optimization.

Finally, implement the agreed changes in Google Ads (or schedule them). Set up any scripts or automated rules for ongoing maintenance of negatives, etc., as decided.

**After implementation**, monitor the impact. The next week or month, check if CPA has improved due to culling waste, and that no traffic drop occurred on important terms due to your negatives or pauses. Essentially, close the loop: an audit is only as good as the actions taken from it.

## Conclusion

Conducting a quarterly keyword audit with these steps keeps your Google Ads account finely tuned for **maximal cost efficiency and functionality**. You’ll continuously prune wasted spend, capitalize on new search trends, and ensure your campaigns (Search and Performance Max alike) run without internal friction. Over time, this disciplined approach boosts your ROI and drives more local store visits for the same budget. It also creates a repeatable service framework – perfect if you want to offer an “on-demand PPC audit” to clients, as you can systematically cover match types, search terms, negatives, location impact, and more in each audit report.

By staying proactive and using the tools at your disposal (scripts, reports, automated dashboards), you transform what could be an overwhelming review into a **streamlined process**. Remember, the paid search landscape and consumer search behavior evolve constantly. Regular audits ensure you’re not doing things “the way they’ve always been done” at the expense of growth. Instead, you’re continually aligning your keywords and targeting with your business goals – driving relevant traffic that converts, at the lowest possible cost. Happy auditing!
