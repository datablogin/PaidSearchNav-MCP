## Claude Review Output

The PR adds comprehensive tests for PostgreSQL URL building that specifically address Issue #36 regarding the PSN_ environment variable prefix. The key test `test_env_var_prefix_not_duplicated` verifies that the prefix isn't duplicated when accessing environment variables. The tests ensure the `_build_postgres_url()` method correctly constructs PostgreSQL connection strings in various scenarios (with/without password, with defaults).
