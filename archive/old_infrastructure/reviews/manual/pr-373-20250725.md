## Claude Review Output

I need permission to fix the syntax error in the file. The issue is that there's a try block without a corresponding except or finally block, which is causing the SyntaxError.

**Review Summary:**

1. **Syntax Error Found**: The reports.py file has a missing except block for the try statement starting at line 177 in the `_generate_report` function.

2. **Issue Implementation**: The commit implements all 7 reporting commands as specified in issue #354:
   - `psn reports view`
   - `psn reports generate`
   - `psn reports generate-bulk`
   - `psn reports export`
   - `psn reports compare`
   - `psn reports trends`
   - `psn reports qbr`

3. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive tests were added (688 lines) but they're currently failing due to the syntax error.

The implementation looks complete but needs the syntax error fixed before it can be merged.
