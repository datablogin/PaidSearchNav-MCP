## Claude Review Output

## Code Review Summary for Issue #353

### ✅ **Implementation Complete**
The CLI geographic analysis commands have been successfully implemented with three main commands:
- `psn geo analyze` - Comprehensive geographic performance analysis
- `psn geo compare` - Location comparison functionality  
- `psn geo export-recommendations` - Export location-specific recommendations

### ✅ **Code Quality**
- Clean, well-structured implementation following project conventions
- Proper error handling with try/except blocks
- Good use of Rich library for formatted output
- Passes all linting (ruff) and formatting checks

### ⚠️ **Missing Tests**
The implementation lacks unit tests for the CLI commands. While other CLI modules have test coverage (e.g., `test_auth.py`, `test_parse_csv.py`), there's no `test_geo.py` file.

### 💡 **Recommendations**
1. **Add unit tests** for the geo CLI commands following the pattern of existing CLI tests
2. **Consider adding integration tests** to verify the full flow with the GeoPerformanceAnalyzer
3. **Document the new commands** in the README or CLI documentation

### 🎯 **Ready for PR**
The implementation is functionally complete and ready to create a pull request. The missing tests can be addressed as a follow-up or added before merging.
