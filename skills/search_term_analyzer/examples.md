## Risk Mitigation

### Before Implementing Negatives

✅ **Verification Checklist**:
- [ ] Check "near me" and location terms - **DO NOT** add as negatives (high performing)
- [ ] Verify brand terms are not being added as negatives
- [ ] Ensure no positive keyword conflicts (e.g., broad match "running shoes" vs negative "shoes")
- [ ] Review seasonal patterns - don't block terms that might convert during peak season
- [ ] Check conversion attribution window - some terms might have delayed conversions

### Conservative Approach for Retail

For local retail businesses:
- **Keep all "near me" searches** - These have 5.1% conversion rate
- **Keep location-specific terms** - "running shoes [city name]"
- **Keep store-related searches** - "running shoes store", "running shoe shop"
- **Be cautious with brand terms** - Even competitor brands might indicate purchase intent

## Notes

**Analysis Confidence**: HIGH
- 90 days of data provides statistical significance

4. Add new keyword opportunities simultaneously

**Review Schedule**:
- Re-analyze search terms in 30 days
- Check for new waste patterns
- Verify negative keywords are working as expected
- Adjust thresholds based on account performance changes
