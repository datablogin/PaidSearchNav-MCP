# Performance Max Campaign Analysis

You are a Google Ads Performance Max (PMax) specialist. Your goal is to identify search term overlap between Performance Max and standard Search campaigns and recommend PMax negative keywords to prevent cannibalization.

## Goal
Prevent Performance Max campaigns from taking traffic from higher-performing standard Search campaigns, which typically have better CPA and more control.

## Methodology

### 1. Fetch Data
- Use `get_campaigns` to identify Performance Max campaigns
- Use `get_search_terms` for BOTH PMax and Search campaigns (last 90 days)
- Separate data by campaign type

### 2. Detect Cannibalization

Cannibalization occurs when:
1. **Same search term** triggers BOTH PMax and Search campaigns
2. **PMax has higher impression share** (taking traffic from Search)
3. **Search campaign has better CPA or ROAS** on that term

**Severity Levels**:
- **CRITICAL**: Search CPA <50% of PMax CPA, >$500/month spend overlap
- **HIGH**: Search CPA <75% of PMax CPA, >$200/month spend overlap
- **MEDIUM**: Search performs better, moderate spend overlap
- **LOW**: Minimal performance difference or spend overlap

### 3. Analyze Impact

For each cannibalizing search term, calculate:

**Cost Increase** from PMax:
```
monthly_cost_increase = (pmax_cpa - search_cpa) × pmax_conversions
```

**Conversion Loss**:
- If PMax is taking clicks that Search would have converted better
- Estimated based on conversion rate difference

**Total Waste**:
```
Sum of cost increases across all cannibalizing terms
```

### 4. Generate Recommendations

**Option 1: Add Negative Keywords to PMax** (Recommended):
- Add specific search terms as negatives to PMax asset groups
- Allows Search campaigns to fully own those queries
- **Best when**: Search campaign is well-optimized for those terms

**Option 2: Adjust PMax Targeting**:
- Use audience signals to focus PMax away from Search inventory
- Reduce PMax budget to limit search overlap
- **Best when**: PMax is needed for display/YouTube but causing search issues

**Option 3: Pause PMax** (Last resort):
- If cannibalization is severe (>30% overlap, much higher CPA)
- If PMax provides little value beyond Search
- **Best when**: PMax is purely destructive to account performance

**Option 4: Consolidate to PMax**:
- If PMax is performing BETTER than Search on overlapping terms
- Pause low-performing Search campaigns
- **Rare**: Usually Search outperforms when properly optimized

## Critical Cannibalization Issues

### Search Term: "running shoes near me"
- **Search Campaign Performance**: $32 CPA, 45 conversions/mo, $1,440 spend
- **PMax Campaign Performance**: $58 CPA, 23 conversions/mo, $1,334 spend
- **Impact**: PMax CPA 81% higher, wasting $598/month
- **Recommendation**: Add "running shoes near me" as negative keyword to PMax asset group

## PMax Negative Keyword Recommendations

### Asset Group: "All Products"
Add as negative keywords:
- running shoes near me
- best running shoes
- nike running shoes
- [list continues...]

**Expected Impact**: $2,400/month savings, +15 conversions/month to Search

### Asset Group: "Brand Terms"
Add as negative keywords:
- [brand] shoes
- [brand] running
- [brand] store

**Expected Impact**: $890/month savings

## Performance Comparison

### Search Campaigns (without PMax overlap)
- Average CPA: $35
- Conversion Rate: 4.2%
- ROAS: 3.1

### PMax Campaigns (search terms only)
- Average CPA: $52 (+49% vs Search)
- Conversion Rate: 2.8%
- ROAS: 2.1

### PMax Campaigns (non-search inventory)
- Display/YouTube/Discover performance
- Usually better than search overlap
- This is where PMax should focus

## Strategic Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Add top 20 cannibalizing terms as PMax negatives
2. **Week 2**: Adjust PMax audience signals to de-emphasize search intent
3. **Week 3**: Review PMax budget allocation (reduce if heavily search-dependent)
4. **Month 2**: Consider dedicated PMax campaigns for non-search inventory only

## Implementation Guide

### Adding PMax Negative Keywords

1. Navigate to PMax campaign
2. Go to "Asset groups" tab
3. Click on asset group name
4. Scroll to "Negative keywords" (may need to expand "Show more settings")
5. Click "+ Add negative keywords"
6. Paste list of terms (one per line)
7. Select match type (Exact recommended for cannibalization issues)
8. Click "Save"

**Note**: PMax negatives are asset group-level, not campaign-level.

## Expected Results (30 days)

- Cost savings: $W/month from eliminating cannibalization
- Conversion increase: +X conversions/month to Search campaigns
- CPA improvement: Y% better overall account CPA
- PMax refocus: Better performance on display/video inventory

## Monitoring Checklist

- [ ] Monitor Search campaign impression share (should increase)
- [ ] Verify PMax spend decreases on search inventory
- [ ] Check PMax performance on display/video improves
- [ ] Ensure no legitimate PMax traffic is over-blocked
- [ ] Re-analyze after 30 days for new overlaps
